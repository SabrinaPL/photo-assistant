# Photo Assistant

Photo Assistant is a dependency-free library written in vanilla JavaScript (ES6) that provides simple photo editing, photo sorting (alphabetically based on img alt) and photo gallery displaying of HTML img elements. It also stores image urls in local storage for easy access and retrieval and offers drawing of edited images onto a canvas element to enable saving of edited images.

Photo Assistant's USP (unique selling point) is that it offers all of these features within the same library, making it useful for a range of applications handling images such as photography portfolio websites, blogs, social media platforms etc. It is also lightweight and easy to use.

## Installation guide

To install Photo Assistant use the following command:

```bash
npm install photo-assistant
```

## Usage guide

To use Photo Assistant, import the library orchestrator into your project:

```javascript
import { PhotoAssistantOrchestrator } from 'photo-assistant'
```

Then, create a new instance of the PhotoAssistantOrchestrator class:

```javascript
const photoAssistant = new PhotoAssistantOrchestrator()
```

To handle photos you need to first add images to PhotoAssistant with the `addImage` method which takes an `HTMLImageElement` as parameter. This could for example be achieved by adding event listeners that listen to click events on image elements already in the document:

```javascript
document.addEventListener ('click', (event) => {
  const images = document.querySelectorAll('img')

  for (let i = 0; i < images.length; i++) {
    images[i].addEventListener('click', (event) => {
      photoAssistant.addImage(images[i])
    })
  }
})
```

! `img alt` description is **required** to add and handle images with PhotoAssistant !

### Edit photos by adding filters

PhotoAssistant allows adding of a single or multiple CSS filters to an image at a time.

![Image with filters added](./test/test-images/photoAssistantFilters.jpg)

To filter images that have been added to PhotoAssistant you add a single or multiple filters with the `chosenFiltersToAdd(filterMethod, filterValue)` method and then apply the chosen filters to the images:

```javascript

photoAssistant.chosenFiltersToAdd(filterMethod, filterValue)

photoAssistant.applyChosenFilters()
```

The `filterMethod` and `filterValue` parameters are of type `string`

```javascript
const filterBtns = document.getElementsByName('filter')
    const filterValueInput = document.getElementById('filterValue')

let filterMethod = ''

    for (let i = 0; i < filterBtns.length; i ++) {
      if (filterBtns[i].checked) {
        filterMethod = filterBtns[i].value.toString()
      }
    }

const filterValue = filterValueInput.value.toString()

    photoAssistant.chosenFiltersToAdd(filterMethod, filterValue)
    photoAssistant.applyChosenFilters()
```

CSS filter methods supported by PhotoAssistant:

```css
filter: blur(2px)
filter: brightness(120%)
filter: contrast(200%)
filter: grayscale(80%)
filter: sepia(100%)
filter: saturate(90%)
filter: opacity(40%)
```

As demonstrated above the blur() filter effect accepts a filter value in px and the rest of the filters accept filter values in %

PhotoAssistant handles assigning px or % to the value depending on the chosen filter effect, so you don't have to.

### Draw images on a canvas element

TO DO: ADD MORE INFO ABOUT THE HTML CANVAS ELEMENT

Draw an image that has been filtered to a canvas element using PhotoAssistant by invoking the `drawPhotosToCanvas(appendCanvasTo, canvasId)` method.

![Example of image drawn to canvas](./test/test-images/nara-filtered.png)

An HTML element to which the canvas element will be appended is sent as the first argument and you give the canvas an id with the second argument.

```javascript
  // After filtering images.

    const canvasContainer = document.getElementById('canvas-container')
    const canvasId = 'photoCanvas'

    photoAssistant.drawPhotosToCanvas(canvasContainer, canvasId)
```

### Sort photos by alphabetical order based on img alt

To sort photos (alphabetically based on their alt descriptions) you invoke the `sortPhotos()` method. This will enable displaying of the images in alphabetical order in the gallery format if the sorting is done before gallery displaying, else the images will be displayed in the gallery in their original order (the order in which they were added to PhotoAssistant).

```javascript
 photoAssistant.sortPhotos()
```

### Display photos in a grid gallery

![Images displayed in a grid gallery](./test/test-images/gallery-in-original-order.png)

To display photos in a grid gallery the `displayPhotosInGallery(columns, galleryContainer)` method is used.

The `columns` parameter is of type `number` and the `galleryContainer` is an HTML element to which the gallery will be appended.

```javascript
  const columnBtns = document.getElementsByName('columns')

  // Optional.
  photoAssistant.sortPhotos()

  for (let i = 0; i < columnBtns.length; i ++) {
      if (columnBtns[i].checked) {
        const columns = Number(columnBtns[i].value)

        const galleryContainer = document.getElementById('gallery-container')
        photoAssistant.displayPhotosInGallery(columns, galleryContainer)
      }
    }
```

### Store images in and retrieve images from local storage

PhotoAssistant automatically stores added images' src to local storage, retrieves them and constructs new img elements from them. It is also possible to invoke methods to store, retrieve and clear local storage independently.

`storePhoto(imageToStore)` takes an HTML img element as argument and stores its src to local storage.

`getStoredPhoto(imageDescription)` takes the alt of the image to be retrieved as an argument, of type string, and returns the new img element constructed from the original img src.

```javascript
    const imageDescription = 'Glico man billboard in Dotonbori in Osaka, Japan'
    photoAssistant.getStoredPhoto(imageDescription)
```

`clearPhotosFromStorage()` resets local storage.
